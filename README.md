## About Me
Hi! I’m Katavina Nguyen, a Software Developer based in Virginia with a strong focus on full-stack development, cloud systems, and large-scale backend engineering. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science and have hands-on experience modernizing enterprise platforms, building microservices, and delivering high-impact features across complex SQL-backed systems.

My core strengths include Python, JavaScript, SQL Server, and full-stack development across modern web and mobile architectures, supported by deep experience with AWS serverless design (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3), distributed systems patterns, and containerized microservice deployments. I’ve rebuilt legacy services into scalable APIs, optimized stored procedures used by hundreds of warehouses, and delivered production platforms that emphasize performance, reliability, and clear operational metrics.

I’m expanding into generative AI, ML, and advanced cloud architectures to broaden the scope of the systems I build. My work style is highly adaptive and action-oriented. I take ownership in ambiguous environments, move quickly without sacrificing quality, and collaborate effectively across teams to deliver results.

I thrive in roles where I can go in-depth into backend logic, improve performance at scale, and build products that have a direct impact on users.
